This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io).  It scrapes lodged development applications from the South Australian [Wudinna District Council web site](https://www.wudinna.sa.gov.au).

All SA applications are now going through the [SA Planning Portal](https://github.com/planningalerts-scrapers/saplanningportal) so this scraper is no longer needed
